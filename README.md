Logically Qualified Data Types
==============================

This repository contains a rust implementation of [liquid
types](http://goto.ucsd.edu/~rjhala/liquid/liquid_types.pdf) on a core
language λ<sub>L</sub> -- a variant of the λ-calculus with ML-style
polymorphism extended with liquid types.
